React Nonogram is a `nonogram puzzle`_ application written in React_, similar to
the official `React Tutorial`_ tic-tac-toe app, but more interesting.

`Play it now! <play_>`_

Installation
============
React Nonogram was bootstrapped with `create-react-app`_, so building it is
pretty straightforward if you have `node installed`_:

.. _create-react-app: https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app
.. _node installed: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

.. code:: shell

   $ git clone https://github.com/smbolton/react-nonogram.git
   $ cd react-nonogram
   $ npm install
   $ npm start  # if you wish to run the development server
   $ npm run build

Copy the resulting files in the ``build`` subdirectory to an appropriate place
on your web server, and React Nonogram should be ready to run.
