      <p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonogram">nonogram</a> is a logic
        puzzle consisting of a regular grid, where the objective is to determine
        which of the grid cells is occupied through the use of clues for each row
        and column. The clues describe contiguous runs of occupied cells, so that a
        clue of “3 1 2” indicates a run of 3 contiguous occupied cells, followed by
        some unknown number of empty spaces, one occupied cell, some number of spaces,
        and finally two contiguous occupied cells.

      <p>You may know nonograms from other products, such as Griddlers, Picross, Picma, or
         Fugazo World Mosaics.
